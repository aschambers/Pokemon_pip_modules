This project was created with the idea to simplify the creation of Pokemon and Pokemon Teams to use at play.pokemonshowdown.com. 

There are times when there is a lot of lag when using pokemonshowdown making it difficult to create a pokemon quickly, and this project solves the problem for the most part. 

When I say "for the most part" I mean it does solve the issue 100% when there is lag when using pokemonshowdown, but when no lag is present, time spent creating a pokemon or pokemon team is only increased by about 20-30%. 

This may or may not be significant for people depending upon experience level when creating pokemon teams. 

There is also documentation in each python file so that is will be easy to understand how to use them.
